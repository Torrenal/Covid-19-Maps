# World Maps for Covid 19

## Blocked - this cannot happen without data, and I haven't found datasets usable for this.
Datasets will need, at minimum, for each date to be plotted:
* Latitude, Longitude for a given population
* Number of deaths associated that population has suffered.
* How large the population is (how many people).

Nice to have:
* Number of infected - While useful, this is subject to strong reporting bias and thus may be unreliable.  People may fail to note they are sick, or just hope for the best while ill and not report it...but deaths are less lieky to be ignored.
* Number of square miles the population covers (aids my naieve handling of borders).
